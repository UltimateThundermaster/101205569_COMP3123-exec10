React + Redux - JWT Authentication

The React + Redux example app runs with a fake backend by default to enable it to run completely in the browser without a real backend api (backend-less), to switch to a real backend api you just have to remove or comment out the 2 lines below the comment // setup fake backend located in the main index file (/src/index.jsx).
